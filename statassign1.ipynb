    "\n",

You take samples of heights from both populations and conduct a t-test to compare the means. If the p-value is less than a predetermined significance level (e.g., 0.05), you reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in heights between males and females in the population. In this example, inferential statistics enable you to make conclusions about the entire population based on the sample data collected."

    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean:\n",
    "The mean, often referred to as the average, is calculated by summing up all the values in a dataset and then dividing by the number of values.\n",
    "It represents the balance point of the dataset, where the values are evenly distributed on both sides.\n",
    "The mean is sensitive to extreme values (outliers) and may not accurately represent the typical value if the dataset is skewed or contains outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median:\n",
    "The median is the middle value in a sorted list of numbers. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",
    "It is less affected by extreme values compared to the mean, making it a robust measure of central tendency, particularly in skewed distributions.\n",
    "The median represents the value that separates the higher half from the lower half of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode:\n",
    "The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset.\n",
    "It is useful for categorical or discrete data where the concept of an average or middle value may not apply.\n",
    "A dataset may have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more than two modes (multimodal).\n",

    "Measures of Variability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range:\n",
    "The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
    "It provides a simple measure of the spread or dispersion of the data.\n",
    "However, the range is sensitive to outliers and may not adequately represent variability in datasets with large ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance:\n",
    "The variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean.\n",
    "It provides a measure of the dispersion of data points around the mean.\n",
    "A higher variance indicates greater variability in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation:\n",
    "The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n",
    "It measures the average distance of data points from the mean.\n",
    "Like variance, a higher standard deviation indicates greater variability in the dataset.\n",
